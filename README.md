# Micropython_libs

### The files here are libraries, drivers, or other software interface classes for the ease of use and communication between Micropython, the hardware we sell, or hardware in which we've worked with.

To name a few, this includes Parallax LCD, OSEPP LCD, NodeMCU pinout for the ESP8266, and more...



## To use the libraries, import the name of the file in your script, then instatiate an object from that import.

### example:
```
	import parallax

	lcd = parallax.LCD()
```
View each library to beecome familiar with each function call for the device.

Some files with weird titles are code from other sources.
